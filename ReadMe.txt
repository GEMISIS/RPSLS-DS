This is an adaption of Rock Paper Scissors based on the TV show
"The Big Bang Theory", called Rock Paper, scissors, lizard, spock.
This game is for the Nintendo DS, and was developed using the devkitPro
toolkit (see http://www.devkitpro.org/ for more details on that).

The underlying code for displaying sprites, backgrounds, text, as well
as the controls, file I/O, and other things, was worked on from
March 2011 until now off and on. This was a small side project
that I have not worked on consistently, but will one day result
in a full library for Developing on the Nintendo DS.  This project
was meant to test the capabilities of the library at the time.

There is a lot of code that is not commented, as this was meant
to be more of an unreleased test for the code, but I have decided
to open source this so others may see what I have done.  There
are potentially many bugs with how certain things are done within
this code.

Please note that this requires the devkitArm and libnds library
that is included in devkitPro to compile.
